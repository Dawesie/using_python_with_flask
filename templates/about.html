    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug
    came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf
    decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf
    also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The
    superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other
    business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. He had a younger brother
            named Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely Mountain.
            Afterwards, he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs
            which culminated in the Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied
            Thráin II, the father of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the Lonely Mountain himself, but Thráin was
            captured and lost.
